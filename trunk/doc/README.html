<h1>Flexcover: A Code Coverage Tool for Flex and AS3</h1>

<p><b>Joe Berkovitz<br>
Allurent, Inc.</b></p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Welcome to the experimental first release of Flexcover.  It isn't
perfect, but it's a start!</p>

<p>This document offers some general information about Flexcover,
explains how to install it, and then walks through a quick tour of its
features.  A concluding reference section describes the command
options, file formats and APIs.</p>
           
<h2>General information</h2>

<p>Flexcover is a code coverage tool for Flex, AIR and AS3.  It
incorporates a modified version of the AS3 compiler which inserts
extra function calls in the code within the SWF or SWC output file.
Applications produced by this modified compiler are called
"instrumented", because the additional generated code acts like a
measuring instrument which detects which lines in the application have
executed, and how often.</p>

<p>At runtime, these function calls send information on the application's
code coverage to a separate tool via a LocalConnection.  The modified
compiler also emits a separate "coverage metadata" file that describes
all the possible packages, classes, functions, code blocks and lines
in the code, as well as the names of the associated source code files.</p>

<p>The companion to this modified compiler is an AIR application called
CoverageViewer.  CoverageViewer works with the coverage data that is
transmitted from an instrumented application running at the same time.
It can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Load coverage metadata files that describe the codebase whose coverage will be measured.

<li>View live code coverage statistics as an instrumented application is run.
  Data from multiple test runs may be accumulated.

<li>View source code annotated with code coverage information.

<li>Save accumulated statistics in an XML report.

<li>Automatically write a report and quit when a test suite indicates
  that testing has concluded.

<li>Load a previously written report and view its contents
</ul>

<p>Flexcover's modified compiler accepts special command line options
that control its behavior, and CoverageViewer can be run using the
<code>adl</code> AIR debug launcher (more convenient than having to install it
from a .air file).

<p>Anything that you want to do with Flexcover can be done on the command
line with shell scripts or batch files.  However, it's much easier and
more platform-independent to invoke Flexcover compilation and coverage
viewing from Ant, so Flexcover also includes a set of powerful Ant
macros and targets derived from the "Antennae" open source project on
Google Code that make it much friendlier and easier to use.

</pre>


<h2>Installing Flexcover</h2>

<h3>1. Software you will need</h3>

<p>You need the following installed on your system:

<ul>
<li>Flex 3.0 SDK or Flex Builder plugin
<li>Java J2SE 1.5+
<li>Ant 1.5+
</ul> 

<h3>2. Create a custom SDK location</h3>

<p>Flexcover uses a customized version of the Flex compiler and also
requires a special library at runtime.  To use flexcover you must
first create a version of the Flex 3 SDK that will be modified to use
this compiler.

<p>To do this, install a copy of the Flex 3.0 SDK somewhere in your
filesystem that is distinct from any existing Flex SDK installation.
("SDK" refers to the directory containing the libraries and
command-line tools that make up Flex, with subdirectories bin/,
frameworks/, and so on.)  For simplicity, you might want to just
download a fresh SDK distribution from <a
href="http://www.adobe.com/go/flex3_sdk">http://www.adobe.com/go/flex3_sdk</a>
and do a fresh install somewhere.  If you have the Flex Builder
Eclipse plugin installed, you can just make a copy of its <tt>sdks/3.0.0/</tt>
subdirectory.

<h3>3. Set up the Ant build environment</h3>

<p>Copy the appropriate build-user.properties.* file to a file named
build-user.properties (without the .mac or .win suffix), and edit its
<tt>flex.dir</tt> property to point to the above custom SDK location.  Be sure
to use forward slashes -- backslashes (and spaces) will need to be
quoted with additional backslashes.

<p>You also may need to modify the <tt>flex.standalone.player</tt>
definition to describe the location the the Flash Player on your
system.  On Windows you probably won't have to do this since the
executable is packaged directly in the SDK.  On the Mac it gets a bit
more complicated since the Player can be installed to various places
depending on your setup.

<h3>4. Modify your custom SDK to use the flexcover compilers and libraries.</h3>

<p>In the main install directory, invoke this command:

<pre>
ant modify-sdk
</pre>

<p>If this command does not succeed, it is very likely because your
build-user.properties file isn't pointing flex.dir at a valid SDK
location.
		

<h2>A quick tour of Flexcover</h2>

<p>If you've gotten this far, you're ready to try things out.  All the
actions in this section will make use of Ant on the command line to build and run the
various applications.  A later section explains the Ant targets in more detail.

<h3>Build and run CoverageExample1</h3>

<p>As a first step, build and run the first sample application.
Change into the <tt>CoverageExample1/</tt> subdirectory and run this
command:

<pre>
ant build
</pre>

<p>This command will build a specially instrumented version of a small
sample Flex application.  Looking in the <tt>bin/</tt> subdirectory,
you will find both <tt>CoverageExample1.swf</tt> and
<tt>CoverageExample1.cvm</tt>.  This latter file is a <b>coverage
metadata</b> file that is used to determine what executable lines
actually exist in the source code, as a basis for coverage
calculations.  If you peek inside this file, you'll see it's a text
file; each line describes one executable fragment of the program.

<p>The following command will run the instrumented CoverageExample1
application, without measuring its coverage:

<pre>
ant flex-launch
</pre>

<p>The application will come up in the standalone Flash player.  At
this point, you may want to browse the source of the application --
there's not very much to it!</p>

<p>(NOTE: if this doesn't launch properly, most likely you don't have
the <tt>flex.standalone.player</tt> property correctly set in your
<tt>build-user.properties file</tt>.  In any case you can always hand-launch
the <tt>bin/CoverageExample1.swf</tt> file from your desktop.)

<h3>Start the Coverage Viewer for CoverageExample1's metadata</h3>

<p>Run the code coverage viewer on CoverageExample1 as follows:

<pre>
ant view-coverage
</pre>

<p>This will launch the CoverageViewer AIR application on the coverage
metadata for CoverageExample1, previously placed by the compiler in
<tt>bin/CoverageExample1.cvm</tt>.
All the data will reflect zero coverage, which is hardly surprising
since the application hasn't started yet!  However, even though no
data has been collected, it's a good moment to explore the features of
the CoverageViewer:

<p><b>Drill-down coverage statistics</b>.  Each line of the main view
is an expandable row describing (in hierarchical order) the coverage for:

<ul>
<li>the entire application
<li>a package within the application (these are not broken out hierarchically)
<li>a class
<li>a single function
</ul>

<p><b>Data columns</b> include: 
<ul>

<li>Coverage Ratio: the percentage of code that has been executed in
this section of the application.  A colored bar in these cells will
change from red through a red/green combination to entirely green as
the coverage ratio ranges from 0% to 100%.

<li>Line Count: the total number of executable lines in this section
of the app.

<li>Coverage Count: the total number of lines in this section which
have actually been executed.

</ul>

<p><b>Source Viewer</b> shows the source code for a class, annotated
with coverage information.  For example, open up the package marked
<tt>pkg</tt> and click the View button for TestClass.  A window named
"TestClass" will open with a coverage breakdown of TestClass at the
top, and a view of the source code below.  Lines are numbered and
annotated with a colored <b>execution count</b> that shows how many
times each line has been executed.  At this point all the counts will
be zero, and all the executable lines will be highlighted in red to
show that they have not been executed so far.

<h3>Collect code coverage statistics for CoverageExample1</h3>

<p>Leaving the viewer up, now start the example app either with
<tt>ant flex-launch</tt> or by otherwise launching <tt>bin/CoverageExample1.swf</tt>.  As you
manipulate the application, the coverage statistics in the viewer will
accumulate and the ratios will start climbing.

<p>As an exercise, see if you can get the application's coverage to
100% by using the source viewer and identifying what code hasn't been
covered yet.  Note that MXML source files have code coverage, not just
ActionScript sources: lines containing data bindings, Bindable
variables or event scripts will count as code.

<p>(Note: The convenient Ant target <tt>ant flex-coverage</tt> will
launch the Coverage Viewer and, a few seconds later, the example
application.)

<p>For better performance, coverage data is buffered in memory and is
only transmitted to the Coverage Viewer at 1-second intervals. You
will notice a short delay between actions in the application and
updates in the viewer.

<h3>Saving and viewing code coverage reports</h3>

<p>Click the <b>Save Report...</b> button at the top of the coverage
viewer's main window.  You will be offered a dialog permitting you to
save an XML coverage report.  Save this file with a <tt>.xml</tt>
suffix and take a look at it -- you will see that it incorporates all
the information in the drill-down coverage table.  Such a report can
be easily formatted or otherwise rearranged with XSL stylesheets.
These saved files can also be reloaded by the Coverage Viewer to view
a report later, or accumulate more data from subsequent test runs.

<p>To load a saved coverage report, use the <b>Load File...</b> button
or simply drop the coverage report file into the application.

<h3>Play with CoverageExample2</h3>

<p>CoverageExample2 is set up exactly like CoverageExample1, only it is a 
larger and richer application.

<h3>Automatically generating code coverage reports</h3>

<p>One of the most useful ways to work with code coverage information
is to automatically generate it as part of a continuous build process,
typically in conjunction with unit or integration test suites that
exercise the code.  The coverage information then becomes a metric
that indicates how successful the tests are at reaching all the code
that is under test.

<p>The <b>CoverageTest</b> AIR project in flexcover is set up to
generate a code coverage report in just this manner.  Running the
<tt>ant test</tt> target will automatically launch the CoverageViewer
in a special mode, in which which it automatically writes a report
when the instrumented application signals that it is finished.  The
same target launches the CoverageTest application a few seconds later;
when the instrumented application quits, the report is written out.

<h2>Reference Information</h2>

<p>This section provides reference information on various aspects of
Flexcover.  It's somewhat incomplete right now, but at least you've
got the source code.

<h3>Coverage compiler reference</h3>

<p>The following special compiler options are supported by the
modified Flexcover SDK's <tt>mxmlc</tt> and <tt>compc</tt> commands:

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><tt>-coverage</tt></td>
<td valign="top">Indicates that coverage instrumentation is to be placed into the generated bytecode of the SWF or SWC.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><tt>-coverage-metadata=<i>metadata-filename.cvm</i></tt></td>
<td valign="top">The name of a coverage metadata file to be output for subsequent use in the Coverage Viewer.  This file will only contain actual data if the <tt>-coverage</tt> option is also given.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Compiler configuration files in the <tt>flex-config.xml</tt> format
may also contain the directive:

<pre>
&lt;coverage&gt;true&lt;/coverage&gt;
</pre>

<p>which has the same effect as the <tt>-coverage</tt> option.

<p>NOTE: You can not run the modified compiler from Flex Builder 3 due
to a Flex Builder bug which prevents custom compiler options from
being invoked within Flex Builder.

<h3>Coverage Viewer command-line options</h3>

<p>One or more input files may be freely specified on the command
line.  They are distinguished solely by their extensions.

<p>Command line elements are as follows:

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><tt>-output <i>report-filename.xml</i></tt></td>
<td valign="top">The name of an XML report file to be written immediately when the instrumented application calls <tt>CoverageManager.exit()</tt>.  The viewer will exit as soon as the report is written.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><tt>-source-path <i>source-directory</i></tt></td>
<td valign="top">The name of a source directory to be searched for source files, if the path information in the coverage metadata does not apply to the environment in which the viewer is running.  More than one source-path directive may be given.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><tt>-connection-name <i>conn</i></tt></td>
<td valign="top">The name to be used for the LocalConnection between the viewer and the application; defaults to <tt>_flexcover</tt>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><tt><i>report-filename.xml</i></tt></td>
<td valign="top">The name of an XML report file to be loaded..</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top" width="200"><tt><i>metadata-filename.cvm</i></tt></td>
<td valign="top">The name of a coverage metadata file to be loaded..</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h3>Coverage Manager API reference</h3>

<p>Instrumented applications may make explicit calls to the
<tt>com.allurent.coverage.runtime.CoverageManager</tt> class to
control various instrumentation options.  See the source code in
<tt>sdk/frameworks/projects/utilities/src</tt> for more details.

<p>The <tt>CoverageManager</tt> class and the global function
<tt>coverage()</tt> are linked from the <tt>utilities.swc</tt> file in
the modified SDK.

<h3>Data format reference</h3>

<p><b>Coverage metadata (.cvm) files</b> are text files that contain a list of
<b>coverage elements</b>, one element per line.  Each coverage element
has this syntax:

<pre>
coverage-element ::=
    package ":" class "/" function "@" line-number [";" source-path]
</pre>

<p>For instance take a look at this excerpt from CoverageExample1.cvm:

<pre>
pkg:TestClass/TestClass@9;C:\Source\flexcover\CoverageExample1\src\pkg\TestClass.as
pkg:TestClass/testFunction@20
pkg:TestClass/staticFunction@25
pkg:TestClass/staticFunction@24
pkg:TestClass/staticFunction@22;C:\Source\flexcover\CoverageExample1\src\pkg\TestClass.as
</pre>

<p>This data format is very inefficient, but it compresses well and is
very easy to generate from within the modified compiler.

<p><b>Coverage instrumentation data</b> transmitted over the
LocalConnection from the instrumented application invokes two handler
functions on the receiving end: <tt>coverageData(map:Object)</tt> and
<tt>coverageEnd()</tt>.  The coverageData function will be passed an
object whose keys are coverage elements and whose values are execution
counts.  The coverageEnd function is called if the instrumented
application has called CoverageManager.exit(), after all remaining
coverage data has been transmitted.

<h2>Known issues and future development</h2>

<ul>
<li>Block and function coverage statistics are needed along with line coverage.  Additional compiler support is needed to identify conditional/loop code blocks and correlate them with the exact source code fragments (of which there are often more than one per line).
<li>The UI is a placeholder and the user experience needs a great deal of attention.
<li>It's desirable to allow instrumented AIR applications to write
coverage data directly to a file, to eliminate the inconvenience of running the CoverageViewer
in parallel.
<li>The internal architecture of the coverage viewer needs much more
work.
<li>The graphical bar renderers sometimes misbehave and persist on the screen.
<li>A clean integration with FlexUnit is highly desirable (e.g. run test suites in AIR, flush coverage data to filesystem at end of run).
</ul>
