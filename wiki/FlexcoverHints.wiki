== !OutOfMemoryError during compilation ==

The Flexcover versions of mxmlc and compc are a little more memory-hungry than the originals.  If your compile in Ant is failing in java with an !OutOfMemoryError, try including the 'fork' and 'maxmemory' attribute in your compilation task, for example:

{{{
   <mxmlc fork="true" maxmemory="512m" ...>
       ...
   </mxmlc>
}}}
