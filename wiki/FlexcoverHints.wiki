== "Not an SDK Directory" error in Flex Builder ==

If you modify an unpacked Flex SDK as directed in the install instructions, and then see an error message in Flex Builder that claims the resulting SDK directory is "not an SDK", the most likely reason is that you used the MacOS Finder or Windows Explorer to copy the modified SDK folders, and did so in a way that caused the complete replacement of the destination folders.  Sticking with `copy` or `cp` on the command line will help avoid this problem.

== !OutOfMemoryError during compilation ==

The Flexcover versions of mxmlc and compc are a little more memory-hungry than the originals.  If your compile in Ant is failing in java with an !OutOfMemoryError, try including the 'fork' and 'maxmemory' attribute in your compilation task, for example:

{{{
   <mxmlc fork="true" maxmemory="512m" ...>
       ...
   </mxmlc>
}}}
